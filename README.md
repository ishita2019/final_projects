Project Name:
Project Types I: Application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation in Astronomy 

Hypotheses:
We are going to answer the three statistical questions as mentioned below:
H0: The star has a planet around it.
Ha: The star does not have a planet around it.
H0: A linear trend fits this data better.
Ha: Cannot find a linear trend to fit this data.
H0: A quadratic trend fits this data better.
Ha: Cannot find a quadratic trend to fit this data.

What we are going to do:
We are going to answer the three statistical questions as mentioned below:
To determine the slope and intercept of a line of best-fit.
To discover a linear trend in this data.
Selection of two baseline models for performing null Hypothesis.
Selected baseline model is a null hypothesis, which we are going to observe.
Implementing a Bayesian probabilistic approach for model fitting as well as model selection to realize the null hypothesis.

Datasets going to use:
Randomly generated data
